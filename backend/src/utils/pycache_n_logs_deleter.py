"""
This script recursively scans the project starting from the resolved root directory 
and deletes target folders matching the specified names (e.g., '__pycache__', 'logs').

### How It Works:
1. **Directory Climbing**: When executed, the script climbs up directory levels starting 
    from the file's current location (`__file__`) until it finds a parent folder whose 
    name matches `ROOT_FOLDER`. This ensures it stays within and operates precisely on 
    the project root without leaking into outer folders (like C:\\ or user directories).
2. **Recursive Traversal**: Starting from that matched root folder, it walks recursively 
    down through all subdirectories (using `os.walk`) to locate and completely delete 
    any folder matching the entries specified in `FOLDERS_TO_REMOVE`.

### Variables & Setup:
- **`ROOT_FOLDER` (string)**:
    Set this to the exact name of your project's root directory (e.g., `"drone_battery_performance_prediction"`).
  *Note: The script will fail to run if this is left empty, serving as a safety lock.*

- **`FOLDERS_TO_REMOVE` (list of strings)**:
    Specify the names of directories you want recursively deleted from the project.
    For example, to clean up Python caching files, logs, and build artifacts:
    ```python
    FOLDERS_TO_REMOVE = ["__pycache__", "logs", ".pytest_cache", "build", "dist"]
    ```
    If left as an empty list `[]`, it defaults to removing `["__pycache__", "logs"]`.

### Usage:
1. Open this script and set the variables:
    ```python
    ROOT_FOLDER = "your_root_folder_name"
    FOLDERS_TO_REMOVE = ["__pycache__", "logs"]
    ```
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python scripts/pycache_n_logs_deleter.py
    ```
